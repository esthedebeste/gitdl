## gitdl

#### !! WINDOWS ONLY !!

gitdl is a tool to easily clone git repositories from the browser to the Desktop folder.

#### Usage

Important: move the exe to a directory in which it won't be removed (or don't, and download it again)

To install, simply run `./gitdl.exe`.

To use it, go to your browser and simply replace the https:// in the repository's URL with gitdl:// and press enter. It'll automatically clone the repository and open up the folder.

For example, `https://github.com/tbhmens/gitdl` => `gitdl://github.com/tbhmens/gitdl`
